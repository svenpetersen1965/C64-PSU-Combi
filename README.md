# C64-PSU-Combi
A PSU for the Commodore C64 and up to two 1541-II floppy disk drives. It is based on a transformer 
for the 9VAC, which is required in a C64 and a (PCB) external power supply module, which provides
the +5V and +12V for the C64 and the 1541-II floppy disk drives. Depending on the used power supply
module, one of the 1541-II connectors can be replaced with an Amiga connection, which also requires 
-12V. This option has not been tested, since I don't have an Amiga. The PSU combi should be strong 
enough.

This build is for the more experienced, since power supplies can be hazzardous and the involved 
mains voltage is potentially lethal.

The power supply has  an open concept and can be configured to taste. It should be planned before 
parts are purchased.
